# R_basics 
I tried to cover all basics of R needed for probability and statistical analysis of data 
this repo has 5 main files ending with .R notation
## content of each file 
* PC0 :
    1. basic arithmatic operations and data types 
    2. logical operations 
    3. assigning variables and understanding their types
    4. writing functions and equations 
    5. creating matrix and use of t, c,cbind, ...
    6. read and write dataframes
* PC1 :
    1. creating randm sample data
    2. finding mean,trimmed mean , median , mode , varience ,standard deviation,
    3. finding standard error , min , max, range , quartile range , IQR
    4. ploting frequency polygon
    5. ploting distribution curve of created random sample data 
* PC2 :
    1. plotting Histogram
    2. plotting pie chart
    3. plotting bar graph
    4. plotting scattor plo
* PC3 :
   * use of dplyr library
        1. filter
        2. arrange
        3. rename 
        4. mutate
   * use of ggplot2 library 
* Practice_iris :
   1. summerize Iris data
   2. plot iris data 
   3.  customized plot petal vs sepal
   4. plot std normal distribution curve 


more things will be added in future...
